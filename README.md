SuperEmbed.js
================
Live demo now available at [jsfiddle.net/h6x04LuL](https://jsfiddle.net/h6x04LuL/)

SuperEmbed.js detects YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, VideoPress, DailyMotion, and more embedded videos on webpages and makes them responsive. Essentially, this means they stretch to fill their container while still maintaining the original aspect ratio.

There's a lot of existing libraries that do this, but I had issues or just didn't like all the ones I tried, so I made my own. And this is it.

**Features**
* Works without external libraries like JQuery
* Works automatically with YouTube, Vimeo, Kickstarter, CollegeHumor, Hulu, Flickr, Vine, VideoPress, DailyMotion, Twitch.tv, and Vid.me embedded videos
* Responsive videos maintain their original aspect ratio
* Responsive layout can be forced or blocked with classes applied to the embed code
* Extremely tiny, the minified version is only 1.6 KB

**Browser support**

| Chrome | Internet Explorer | Firefox | Safari | Opera |
| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:|
| 4.0+ | 9.0+ | 3.5+ | 3.2+ | 10+ |

**How to use**

You can put the SuperEmbed script wherever you want on the page:
```
<script src="superembed.min.js"></script>
```
Then it will automatically resize any supported embedded videos. That's it.

*Note: If you already use JQuery, and you load SuperEmbed sometime after it, it will use JQuery to detect when the page is loaded and the window is resized (instead of DOM JavaScript).*

**Advanced features**

If you want to make an embedded video (or really any element) responsive, but it's not automatically detected by SuperEmbed, you can add the `.superembed-force` class to it like this:
```
<iframe src="http://www.example.com/video" class="superembed-force"></iframe>
```
You can also tell SuperEmbed to not resize a specific embed by adding the `.superembed-ignore` class, like this:
```
<iframe src="http://www.example.com/video" class="superembed-ignore"></iframe>
```
And finally, you can force a 1:1 aspect ratio by adding the `.superembed-square` class, like this:
```
<iframe src="http://www.example.com/video" class="superembed-square"></iframe>
```
